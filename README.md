# Training the higher CSS in React

Exercise : create a card with components chosing a CSS / React method

CSS method chosen : EMOTION because it seems to be close to CSS in the using, and it make the code lisible by having clean components/html elements (versus Tailwind for example) and by centralizing the code.
However, the gain is, for me, really low (almost negative) in terms of praticity/rapidity compared to Tailwind.
